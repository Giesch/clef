* Now

* Next
- [ ] replace icons with slightly darker color
  - convert to pngs?
  - modify iced to use theme text_color for svg currentColor?

- [ ] add a hash or id to resized image names

- [ ] load a nice startup ui quickly
  - [ ] last played song - progress and scroll?

- [ ] integration test the crawler and resizer
  with filesystem & db, without audio/ui

- [ ] in player, if audio output is present,
  then spec and duration should still be validated

- [ ] in ui, current_song and progress should be in one optional

- [ ] add song durations to view
  - [ ] for currently playing song
  - [ ] in the album song list

- [ ] make a custom slider / player progress widget
  style it differently
  no mouse interaction when disabled
  change mouse interaction consistently on release

- [ ] thumbnail album art for currently playing song
  or next to songs in a non-album view

- [ ] handle metadata correctly in the audio thread
  https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#consuming-metadata
  was symphonia-play doing that in the print helpers?

- [ ] switch to tracing from env-logger
  look into whether it plays nice with iced exector

- [ ] read symphonia docs thoroughly
- [ ] read iced examples thoroughly

- [ ] handle graceful shutdown on the audio thread
  need a typed return from the run method?
  or a way for the ui to join audio instead of disconnecting

- [ ] make a full custom app theme

- [ ] think about a way to type-enforce using immediate transaction for writes
  like a custom pool wrapper or something
  might need a delegate macro for that to not be super annoying
  does sqlite have read-only connections?

- [ ] handle the audio thread errors gracefully
  restart the audio thread?
  go through the possible errors to see what could be done
  ie; missing/bad file = tell the ui about it and stop
    can test this by deleting the file after startup

* Someday
- [ ] playlists
- [ ] current queue (treat like another kind of playlist)
- [ ] other views

- [ ] handle missing time data on track info
  currently it just logs and uses zero
  should transition to an error state at the beginning
  ie have an Option<TrackInfo> with guaranteed fields
  instead of a TrackInfo with two optional fields
  does that mean refusing to play the song at all, though? need the id

- [ ] integration tests
- [ ] restart audio thread after a crash

- [ ] help improve iced's image handling
- [ ] Address scrolling lag when necessary

- [ ] keyboard support
  - [ ] space for play/pause
  - [ ] support media keys
  - [ ] tab navigation

- [ ] drag and drop import

- [ ] non-latin text (use cosmic's stuff early?)
  https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/1454

- [ ] select the music directory with a menu/modal, and cache it
- [ ] select the config directory based on platform

- [ ] add a subtle play button to album art

- [ ] reconsider assumptions re: audio directory
  - the crawler only goes one layer deep
  - songs get their album id based on directory instead of tag
