  use these for places that are cloning paths/strings

  need to look up the current track in the ui state from the event

  this requires the ability to remember a queue on the player side

- [ ] make the play track buttons nicer
  - [ ] subtler style
  - [ ] display on hover
  - [ ] keep the playing track in sync with main play button

  https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#consuming-metadata
  was symphonia-play doing that in the print helpers?

  look into whether it plays nice with iced exector

- [ ] read symphonia docs thoroughly
- [ ] read iced examples thoroughly

  or a way for the ui to join audio instead of disconnecting

* Someday
- [ ] sqlite setup
  - [ ] load a nice startup ui quickly

- [ ] restart audio thread after a crash

- [ ] make the slider smoother

  - [ ] space for play/pause
  - [ ] support media keys
  - [ ] tab navigation
